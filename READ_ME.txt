All the code is located in the "Project" folder. Code is contained within a Jupyter Notebook.

Thank you for reviewing my application.
Unfortunately, due to bad health, I started this application today, so I was not able to complete all parts.
However, I have experience using sklearn for past projects, and did have a plan to create a decision tree in order to
complete the .predict() method.
While I understand that any work done past the deadline will not count as a part of my final application, and won't
increase my chances of getting in, I'm invested in this project now, so I'll still be working on it :)

Thanks again for the opportunity! I've learned so much about the application process just by going through the first
round. Thank you to all the people at Techpoint that make this opportunity possible for so many!
